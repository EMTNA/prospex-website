                    <p><b>The Problem: </b>Islington lacks interesting, engaging, open, free spaces for young people to spend their time outside. In certain instances, young people become entrenched in gang culture and unwilling to move into new, unfamiliar spaces because of shyness, wariness, or safety issues.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>What we offer: </b>Our Street Teams exist to make sure young people are safe and well, wherever they are. If they’d rather not come to the centre, our staff check in on them in their local area. This builds a mutual trust and allows positive relationships to be formed. Our team become familiar faces, and get to know the wider community as well as the young people themselves.
                        <br>
                        Being a visible presence on the streets and building relationship with young people in public also helps dispel the myth that young people aren’t approachable, or are out to cause trouble. Our teams has been able to diffuse volatile situations on the streets amongst young people and their communities. Early interventions like this help improve relationships amongst different groups and generations in the areas we work in, as well as the young people themselves.</p>

                        <p><b>Outcomes: </b> Our joint Street Team’s work has reduced antisocial behavior and the criminalisation of young people in the geographical areas we cover. Whilst that is the main focus of our outreach programme, we have also helped young people back into work, education and apprenticeships, and also provided access to sex and relationships advice and condoms through the Come Direct Scheme.</p>

                    <p><b>The Problem: </b>Many schools do not have the resources to offer learning mentors or individual support for young people. Often, neither do their parents. Growing up is hard enough; if they see their families struggling and their own prospects feel bleak, it is even harder. Worry can turn to frustration and quickly, to anger: this can lead to poorer attainments at school, or cause harm to their mental health.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>What we offer: </b>We allocate young people a Dedicated One2One worker based on their needs and circumstances. Our One2one work could range from a few sessions helping a young person complete a application form, to many years working with them and their families to help overcome a range of complex issues which, together, can have a serious impact on their wellbeing.
                        <br>
                        Most of our One2One referrals come from our own work streams. As such, we can start from a place of mutual respect and not have to spend multiple sessions getting to know the young person and building trust.

                    <p><b>Outcomes: </b> Through regular one-to-one sessions with their personal worker, young people have a constant in their life – someone who will listen to them, encourage them, raise their aspirations and give them the confidence to overcome what is holding them back from reaching their potential. Our flexible approach allows our workers to meet and communicate with their young person whenever suits both parties, even if this means meeting outside of the normal arranged times.</p>

When I first contacted Prospex to turn my son around not only did you come to my home, you asked me what I would like from our meetings. I said, ‘I wanted to get my son back and off the streets.’ At the time he was constantly being arrested and had made bad choices with friends. By meeting with him weekly and supporting us as a family you have changed his attitude, his behaviour and his general persona. I feel you have gone over and above for my son, believed in him and given him the tools he needs in life. I am truly thankful.”</i></p>

                    <p><b>The Problem: </b>For most of the children who use our centre they have neither the life skills needed to thrive as adults, nor the adequate space within which to learn them. This can include the basic skills such as using a computer for younger children, confidence for girls and the ability to cook and eat nutritious meals for our older members. For others, such as the children who reside in homeless shelters, Centre offers a space for them to eat a warm meal and feel safe.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>What we offer: </b>Our Centre is open for young people aged 8 to 24. Three times a week we not only teach the young people how to make a nutritious meal, but we also encourage them to sit and enjoy their dinner together. Once a week, we offer an empowerment session for girls, and as of 2019 this will be extended to a boys session also. Prospex are keen to ensure that the women leaving our service are confident and aware of the importance of indepence.
                        <br>
                        We also understand the importance of supplementing a quality of life that isn’t available at home for most of our attending young people. So we invest heavily in games and electronics materials in our centre. Further to this, every Christmas, our staff provide a gifts and christmas dinner to the families of our children that cannot afford it.

                    <p><b>Outcomes: </b> Each year, we provide over 4000 meals to Islington’s children and 1800 hours of free child care to the parents whose children use our service. For many of our parents, the existence of Prospex’s centre based work is the difference between being able to work and having to stay at home.
