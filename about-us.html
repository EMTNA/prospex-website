                    <p>
                        Prospex is an award-winning grassroots youth charity based in Islington, supporting young people aged 8-21* whose life chances are affected through measures outside their control; poverty, social
                        <br>
                        Islington is the 12th most deprived local authority in the country and the 4th most deprived in London. 35% of Islington’s children are living in low income families and just under one in three young people deprivation, high unemployment and crime.live in households where nobody is working. And worryingly, Islington children are 33% more likely to suffer from mental health issues than the national average.
                        <br>
                        Founded in 2001, the organisation works to address these negative influences, often resulting in low self-esteem and poor school attendance, leading to limited employment prospects.  We establish positive relationships and provide opportunities, build life and employability skills. Young people are able to broaden their horizons outside the limits of their existing thinking and are given the tools to achieve their goals.
                        <br><br>
                        * We aim to provide support for 21-24 as they transition out of our care. This is not attached to any grant or funding and is undertaken as a voluntary in staff members’ own time.

Whether this means taking homeless teenagers on their first trip to see the ocean, or ensuring that the girls we work with are empowered and confident, we believe that every child deserves to live a life filled with fun and enriching experiences.</p>
